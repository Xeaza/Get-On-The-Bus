- Using some custom json data of cta bus data we display all the bus stops in Chicago in a MKMapView

- Each bus stop has an annotation that when clicked says the name and routes of that bus stop. There is also a detail accessory to click on to view a detail page about that stop.

- There is also a segmented controller that that switches between the mapView and a tableView with the same data as the annotations display.
